3. Greedy      
4. A*                   

Each function returns a SearchResult namedtuple containing:
- path: list of node names from source to goal
.- cost : total path cost in metres (0 for BFS)
- nodes_expanded: count of nodes popped from the frontier
- nodes_generated: count of nodes added to the frontier
- frontier_log: list of (step, node, g, h, f) for visualisation

All search algorithms are hand-coded; only heapq is used for priority queue

Time-Dependent variants (TD-UCS, TD-A*) are included as separate functions that accept a departure time slot (0–95).
